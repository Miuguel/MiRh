# MiRh

**MiRh** is an experimental project that explores the application of numerical methods to simulate differential equations, specifically focusing on heat distribution in a 2D plate and image deconvolution. The main idea is to use calculus concepts, such as differential equations and approximation methods, to create interactive visual representations, simulating physical phenomena using colors.

## 🧮 Objective

The goal of **MiRh** is to learn various numerical and programming concepts while demonstrating the versatility of numerical methods in solving complex problems. The primary application explored so far involves simulating heat propagation in images, represented by color changes, and blind image deconvolution using the Sylvester resultant matrix.

## 🚀 Features

- Simulations based on numerical methods.
- Graphical representation of value propagation (such as heat) over a pixel matrix.
- Image blurring using the ADI (Alternating Direction Implicit) method.
- Blind Image Deconvolution (BID) based on the Sylvester matrix.
- Conversion of numerical results into visual transformations, using colors to represent different states.
- Examples with classic images (e.g., cameraman).

## 📖 Project Motivation & Evolution

This project started as an attempt to solve the heat equation in a 2D space using computational methods. Initially, loops were used, but as an optimization exercise, the calculations were later converted to matrix operations. However, in some cases, the solution became unstable.

At this point, my advisor, Ralph, explained to me that what I had just implemented was equivalent to applying a convolution with a specific kernel on a matrix representing the 2D space. He also introduced me to the **Von Neumann stability condition** and the **Crank-Nicholson method**, developed by John Crank and Phyllis Nicolson, which solves this differential equation in an implicit and stable way.

However, the book I was referencing (**EDP - Um curso de Graduação** by Valeria Iório) described the algorithm in one dimension. Extending it to two dimensions would lead to an exponential growth in the matrix size that needed to be solved, even when using sparse matrix techniques.

That's when I thought of a solution that would break the problem into alternating directional steps. After some research, I discovered the **Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method**, which is not only implicit (thus stable) but also takes advantage of sparse matrices to optimize the solution of the Sylvester matrix equation **(AX + XB = C)**.
